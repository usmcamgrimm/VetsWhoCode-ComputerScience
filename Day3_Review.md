DAY 3
Week 10 - Comp Sci with Javascript
-------------------------

## Review and Wrap up

Our last class, short and sweet.

**We’ve covered:**

* Modulo / Circular Array
* Big O
* Call Stack
* Recursion
* OOP / Classes
* Data Structures
* Overview of Algorithms
* Binary and Hexadecimal
* Sorting

-------------------------

Make sure you do all the assignments!
Even if you are having trouble - at least try.
You can always come back.

Highly recommend a github repository!

--------------------------

These topics are very broad, and can go very deep.
For the most part, frontend development won’t require much of this.
But interviewing, general knowledge, and upward mobility - it’s very useful!

--------------------------

**Things we didn’t cover:**

* Discrete Math
* Computer Architecture / Dataflow
* Operating Systems
* NP-Complete Problems
* Database Systems
* Computability, language theory

These things are too far off our target - which is frontend development!

**Moving forward:**

Here are two hackerrank problems I’ve selected. These are optional.

1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/repeated-string/problem

2. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/between-two-sets/problem

Keep practicing and keep on learning.

Focus and Data structures and Algorithms and you can’t go wrong!

Thank you!
