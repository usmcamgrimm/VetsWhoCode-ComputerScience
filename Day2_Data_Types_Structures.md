No Article because there are many different data structures.

You can go down whichever road you please, but you must implement the given 4 below.

-------------------------

## More on Data Types ##

**Types:** 

Primitive, Composite, ADT

Examples of Primitives?

You guys *should* know this by now


Composite Data Types:
1. Think of the word ‘composite’
2. Just a combination of primitive datatypes
3. Combined, they form a singular composite DT.

- Examples? Arrays, Lists, Tuples, Collections, etc.

Abstract Data Types:
1. Simply, “Objects” (or classes)
2. Custom objects built to do a job
3. Mostly in the form of “containers”, i.e., a Player class is a container for all the things a Player does

_ADT’s are the foundation for OOP and object manipulation_

-------------------------

Data Structures
A set of ADT’s that each serve specific purposes
Most are implemented natively, or in standard libraries
Foundational - manage the underlying flow and structure of programs

There are MANY Data Structures
Data Structures are implemented all the time!
- Customized to how YOU want to handle a problem set

-------------------------

Some “Lower Level” data structures: (don’t be too concerned)
These mostly require memory pointers, used in C and assembly

* Linked List, Doubly Linked-List, etc.
* Trees (Binary, Heaps, B-trees, AVL trees)
* Graphs - (nodes-edges graph, not your typical math graph)


**What we will worry about:**

* “Higher Level”, array-like data structures:
* Set
* Stack
* Queue
* Map / Hash (actually, just an object-literal in Javascript!)


Start to think about what each of the above 4 data structures do.
What makes them... them?
This is the first step to self-implementation
I.E, What do we want our “Set” to do?


Before moving on, try to guess or think about what each of these do!

-------------------------

**Set**

* A set is just an unordered list (like an array) - but it has NO duplicates!
* Think of a math set {1, 2, 3}, etc.


**Stack**

* We went over stack already
* LIFO - Last in, first out!
* What does a Stack class do?
* We can add to the stack
* We can remove from the stack
* We can check if the stack is empty or not
* We can initialize it in multiple ways, too


**Queue**

* Kind of the opposite of a stack
* FIFO - First in, first out!
* It’s just a line, like the line at the grocery store
* Now, think about what a Queue does


**Map / Hash**

* Think of an object-literal in JS.
* It has a Key and that key reveals a Value
* Key --> Value
* Think of an array... what’s the key?... the index!
* What else can our Map class do? Add, remove, etc?

Of course, these data structures can be easily called from native JS or libraries.

Self-implementation helps you understand their structure

While also allowing you your own customization!

-------------------------

**Assignment**

* Implement a Class for each of Set, Stack, Queue, Map
* Each one should cover all of its capabilities
* Each one can be initalized either empty (no parameters), OR with initial values
* Implement obj.isEmpty()
* Implement a “Type” Parameter (optional)
* This parameter enforces types in your data structure, ie, all strings, all integers, etc.
* Will throw error (or output a message) if you add a value that is not of the correct type
* For Map, you will need two of these, one for Key, one for Value

**Notes:**

* For Map, you can ONLY USE arrays.
* NO OBJECT-LITERALS. - That’s cheating!
* Avoid built-in functions, if it feels like a shortcut, then it is a shortcut

**Extras:**

Implement obj_1.equals(obj_2), where both objs are of the same Class
This checks if all values (and in some cases, the order) are equal

Congrats, you’ve built four of your own data structures!

You are free to add and manipulate them how you like!
For example, look up Priority Queue (little advanced)
